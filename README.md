AI Pipeline for Image Segmentation and Object Analysis

This project builds an AI pipeline to segment, identify, and analyze objects within an image. The pipeline uses deep learning models for image segmentation, object extraction, text/data extraction, summarization of object attributes, and mapping data to generate a final output.

Steps and Deliverables

1. Image Segmentation: Segment all objects within an input image using a pre-trained model.
2. Object Extraction and Storage: Extract each segmented object and save them as separate images with unique IDs.
3. Object Identification: Identify and describe each object using a pre-trained model.
4. Text/Data Extraction from Objects: Extract text/data from each object using OCR.
5. Summarize Object Attributes: Summarize the nature and attributes of each object.
6. Data Mapping: Map unique IDs, descriptions, extracted text/data, and summaries to each object.
7. Output Generation: Generate the final output image with annotations and a table summarizing all data.
